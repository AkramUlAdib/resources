<p>Please note, Foursquare have redesigned their website especially the frontend UI. This means that not all URL's will work as shown in the video coming up and the Frontend website might look a bit different to you compared to what's shown in the video. Although please rest assured that any code we write as part of this course is still up to date and will work.</p><p>Because the UI has changed, we will be providing you with updated URL's so you can still follow the course without having to look for it yourself.</p>
